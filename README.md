# MLOps for Medical Imaging Made Easy 🖥️
==============================

This course offers a thorough examination of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) as they relate to computer vision. The course starts with an overview of MLOps and computer vision, then delves deeply into the fundamentals of machine learning and particular computer vision approaches. 

Attendants will get knowledge of the major MLOps platforms and technologies as well as appropriate data management techniques. The model development lifecycle is also covered in the course, with an emphasis on hyperparameter optimization and model validation. By integrating MLOps into computer vision research, researchers can ensure that their models are not only theoretically sound but also practically viable, capable of being deployed and maintained in real-world environments.

A case study on the use of MLOps in medical imaging offers helpful advice. An examination of upcoming MLOps trends and problems brings the course to a close. The course is intended for those interested in the operational elements of machine learning models, particularly in the context of computer vision. It is necessary to have some prior programming expertise, and a fundamental understanding of machine learning techniques.
